# This file can be used to modify the ADC modelling space.
#   model set: The set of ADCs used to produce the final model.
#   constraints: Design constraints for ADC parameters

model constraints:
  # ADCs with a quality between min percentile and max percentile are chosen
  # for the final model.
  # Quality is defined by how close to the Pareto-optimal line an ADC is.
  min pareto percentile: 95 # Base model on the top 10% of ADCs found
  max pareto percentile: 98 # But ignore top 2%

  # The model set is expanded as needed to include all listed percentiles.
  #include percentiles:
  #  area (mm^2):
  #  energy per inference (pJ/op):
  #  frequency (Hz):
  #    - 10 # Ensure model set includes ADCs <= 10th percentile frequency
  #    - 90 # Ensure model set includes ADCs >= 90th percentile frequency
  #  tech node (nm):
  #    - 10
  #    - 90 # Specific to the Murmann dataset: There are many older tech node
  #         # ADCs that we don't need to force into the Pareto group
  #  number of bits:
  #    - 10
  #    - 90 # Specific to Murmann dataset: Many high-resolution ADCs that we
  #         # don't need to force into the Pareto group

input constraints:
  # There are two ways to add input constraints:
  #   min/max: A minimum and maximum value are set based on provided values
  #   min percentile/max percentile: A minimum and maximum value are set based
  #                                  on the given percentile in the dataset.
  # Any combination of the four parameters may be supplied. If both min and
  # min percentile or both max and max percentile are supplied, then the more
  # restrictive of the two options will be picked when building the model.

  area (mm^2):
    max percentile: 90 # Get rid of highest-area ADCs

  energy per inference (pJ/op):
    max percentile: 95 # Get rid of highest-energy ADCs

  frequency (Hz):
    min percentile: 1
    max percentile: 99
    min value: 1000000 # 1MHz
    max value: 5000000000 # 3GHz

  tech node (nm):
    min percentile: 0 # Tech node fine; just here as a placeholder

  bits:
    max value: 20 # No super high resolution ADCs
